#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

#  Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as to inject date/other infos into it.

# Visual Studio Code
#  Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#  that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer,
#  you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
.vscode/

# Ruff stuff:
